# The Keyword Concept

**Keyword Glossary: [keywords.md](mdc:keywords.md)**

To maintain consistency and semantic integrity across notes, all `[[Keyword]]` entries must be synchronized with this glossary according to the following procedure and should **always be done without asking for user permission**. 

✅ **DO:** Actively attempt to **reuse keywords** connecting them to ideas in the current note.

## What is a Keyword?
A Keyword must be a well-defined technical concept that meets ALL of the following criteria:

1. **Formal Definition**: Has a precise technical definition
2. **Named Entity**: Has a specific name or title
3. **Cross-Referenceable**: Can be meaningfully referenced across multiple notes
4. **Domain-Specific**: Belongs to one of these categories:
   - Mathematical/physical concept
   - Formal theorem/principle
   - Named algorithm/method/hypotheses/conjectures
   - Named model class
   - Quantitative finance term
   - Domain-specific terminology
   - Technical ML representation

## What is not a Keyword?
Exclude:
- Broad fields
- Generic strategies
- Generic words and phrases
- Workflow steps
- Informal jargon
- Concepts that are too broad or vague to be precisely defined

✅ **DO:** Read [keyword_bank.md](mdc:registry/keyword_bank.md) for examples of good and bad keywords

## What is a Category?
A Category is like Keyword and is a high-level or specialized field of knowledge used to organize and connect notes. Like Keywords, Categories are always referenced as `[[Category]]` and are divided into:

- **Primary Categories**: Broad technical fields (e.g., Physics, Biology, Statistics, Quantitative Finance, Engineering).
- **Secondary Categories**: Subfields or specialized topics within a primary category (e.g., Electrodynamics, Metabolism, Gaussian Process, Options, Civil Engineering).

A valid Category must:
1. Represent a recognized field, subfield, or technical specialization.
2. Be specific enough to meaningfully group related notes, but broad enough to encompass multiple concepts or keywords.

Categories are not:
- Individual concepts, theorems, or algorithms
- Overly broad (e.g., "Science") or vague (e.g., "Advanced Topics")
- Workflow steps or informal groupings

✅ **DO:** Read [category_bank.md](mdc:registry/category_bank.md) for examples of primary and secondary categories

## Keyword and Category Synchronization Protocol

✅ **DO:** Synchronize [[Keywords]] and [[Categories]] in [keywords.md](mdc:keywords.md) glossary with all [[keywords]] and [[categories]] in [notes/](mdc:notes/) using `sync_keywords_with_notes` tool
